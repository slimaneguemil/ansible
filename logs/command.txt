playbooks contents

users.yml :create a user and display results
logs.yml : manage logs

remarque : the target now is handle by a variable "nodes". this latter when running ansible-playbook with  -e "nodes=target"

how to run the playbook.
step1 :
edit main.yml and input include variable accordingly


step 2:
ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml -e "nodes=centos" -K
or
ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml -e "nodes=all" -K


you can avoid typing paramaters -i inventory by create environment varibale
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=inventory
